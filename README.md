# ðŸ“š My Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal timeline of knowledge!

This repository is a collection of everything I'm learning, exploring, and creating in the fields of programming, science, economics, and beyond. My goal is to document my progress, organize my thoughts, and share resources and projects that have been part of my journey. I am really excited to the only thought of knowledge, and I really can't stop studying.

## ðŸŒŸ What's Inside?
- My notes (yeah, exactly).
- Links, articles, and references that helped me and I'd recommend.

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered
- Computer Science
- Mathematics
- Economics
- German Learning

## ðŸš€ Why This Repo?

I believe that learning is a continuous journey, and documenting it helps me stay focused and motivated. I've also always loved to teach others, and since, in real life, I don't really have a chance to do this yet, it makes me excited to share my knowledge on GitHub to, possibly, help other students! :)
