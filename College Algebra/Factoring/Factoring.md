Let's take this an an example

$$
x^{2} + 5x + 6
$$
I can factorize this quadratic expression as it follows

$$
(x+2)(x+3)
$$

## Method 1: Pull out the GCF (MCD)
### Example 1

$$
15+25x$$
The number that divides both 15 and 25x is 5.

$$GCF = 5$$
Therefore, now I can multiply 

$$5(3+5x)$$
#### Example 2

$$x^{2}y + y^{2}x^{3}$$
The GCF (Greatest Common Factor) of terms with the same base is the base raised to the smallest exponent among them. Therefore:

$$GCF = x^{2}y$$
$$x^{2}y(1 + xy)$$

## Method 2: Factor by grouping
#### Example 1

$$x^{3} + 3x^{2} + 4x + 12$$
We factor separately the first two terms and the last two terms.

$$x^{2}(x + 3) + 4(x + 3)$$Since the arguments are the same, we can further factor the expression

$$(x^{2}+4)(x+3)$$We cannot further more because $$x^{2}+4$$ is not factorizable.

## Factor of quadratics
#### Example 1

$$x^{2}-6x+8$$

This is usually factorized as it follows

$$(x \pm \dots)(x \pm \dots)$$

To factorize, we have to find two numbers that **sum to 6x, and multiply to 8**. To do that, we have to factorize 8

| 1   | 8   |
| --- | --- |
| 2   | 4   |
| -1  | 8   |
| -2  | -4  |

And so on... as we can see, though, the constant has a positive sign. Therefore, we instantly understand that we cannot have different sign numbers.

The numbers that **multiply to 8** and **sum to -6** are **-2 and -4**

$$-4 - 2 = -6$$$$-2 \cdot -4 = 8$$
Therefore, I can now write the expression as it follows

$$(x-2)(x-4)$$
#### Example 2 (Important)

$$10x^{2}+11-6$$
1. Multiply the coefficient of squared x for the constant number, excluding the x squared

$$10x^{2} \cdot (-6) = -60$$
2. Take the coefficient of x and write down a schema like the one down:

3. Take two numbers that **Multiply to -60** and **Sum to 11**. As we can see, the constant is negative, therefore, we need to use different signs.

| -1  | 60  |
| --- | --- |
| -2  | 30  |
| -3  | 20  |
| -4  | 15  |

The numbers are **-4** and **15**. Therefore I write them down

4. Rewrite the expression as it follows

$$10x^{2} - 4x + 15x  -6$$

$$2x(5x - 2) + 3(5x - 2)$$
The arguments are the same, so

$$(2x+3)(5x-2)$$

## Difference of squares

Achtung: You cannot apply this form if it's a sum of squares.

#### Example 1
$$a^{2} - b^{2}$$
$$(a+b)(a-b) = a^{2} - ab + ba - b^{2} = a^{2} - b^{2}$$

#### Example 2
$$9p^{2} - 1$$
$$(3p)^{2} - 1^{2}$$
$$(3p + 1)(3p - 1)$$

---

## Difference or sum of cubes

$$a^{3}-b^{3} = (a-b)(a^{2} + ab + b^{2})$$
$$a^{3}+b^{3} = (a+b)(a^{2}-ab+b^{2})$$
#### Example 1

$$y^{3} - 27$$
$$y^{3} - 3^{3}$$
$$(y+3)(y^{2} + 3y + 9)$$
